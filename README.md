# ImpactionalGames Client

This project was created as a prototype client website during my time as an Assistant Backend Developer Intern at Impactional Games. This is primarily a game-betting website
where users can play games with an entry fee and winner's cut. I was tasked with Unity game integration and the entire frontend and backend of the client and admin prototypes
completely individually.

The website is fully responsive. I have attached some pictures at the end showing its responsiveness.
